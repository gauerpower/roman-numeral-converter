# roman-numeral-converter
Extended version of the Roman numeral converter project from FreeCodeCamp. Beyond FCC's passing requirements, I added a feature to convert in reverse (original assignment was just Arabic-to-Roman; this version can also convert Roman-to-Arabic). Also created a basic HTML/DOM page to run these functions.
